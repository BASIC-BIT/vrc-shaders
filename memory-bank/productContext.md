# Product Context

*   **Problem:** VRChat users desire expressive and unique eye shaders for their avatars that go beyond static textures. They seek visually appealing effects, often with a "cute" or "dreamy" aesthetic, that incorporate dynamic elements like animation and audio reactivity (AudioLink), without being overly distracting during social interactions. Existing shaders might lack specific desired features or unique visual twists (e.g., standard infinite mirrors).
*   **Solution:** The "Rainbow Heartburst Iris" shader addresses this by providing a highly customizable eye effect combining several dynamic features:
    *   Animated rainbow iris rings for vibrant color.
    *   A cute, pulsing heart-shaped pupil.
    *   A unique infinite mirror effect using layered, progressively blurred hearts instead of circles.
    *   Animated, parallaxing sunburst streaks for added depth and visual interest.
    *   AudioLink integration for reactivity to music and world sounds.
    *   Subtle screen-space glow/flare effects for emphasis.
    *   Optional environmental lighting response.
    *   Extensive customization via shader parameters and a dedicated GUI.
*   **User Experience Goals:** Users should feel their avatar's eyes are lively, expressive, captivating, and fit a "cute," "dreamy," or "magical" aesthetic. The shader should enhance social presence by reacting subtly to the environment (audio, light) and user-controlled parameters (via VRChat menus). The effects should be visually pleasing and hypnotic but adjustable to avoid being overly distracting. Customization should feel intuitive and powerful, allowing users to tailor the look precisely.
*   **Key Use Cases:**
    *   Enhancing avatar expression and personality in VRChat.
    *   Socializing in various VRChat worlds, especially music or themed events where dynamic effects are appreciated.
    *   Creating visually distinct avatars that stand out.
    *   Use in avatars with cute, magical, fantasy, or stylized themes.
